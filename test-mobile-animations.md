# Mobile Animation Disable Test

## Overview
This document outlines how to test that animations are properly disabled on mobile devices.

## Test Steps

### 1. Desktop Testing
1. Open the website on a desktop browser
2. Navigate through different pages
3. Verify that animations are working:
   - Header loading animation
   - Hero section animations
   - Featured products carousel
   - Page transitions
   - Hover effects
   - Scroll animations

### 2. Mobile Testing
1. Open the website on a mobile device or use browser dev tools to simulate mobile
2. Navigate through different pages
3. Verify that animations are disabled:
   - No loading animations
   - No hover effects
   - No scroll animations
   - No page transition animations
   - Elements appear immediately without fade-in effects

### 3. Browser Dev Tools Testing
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M)
3. Select a mobile device (e.g., iPhone 12)
4. Refresh the page
5. Verify animations are disabled

### 4. CSS Verification
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to the Elements tab
3. Check that the following CSS is applied on mobile:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 767px) {
     *,
     *::before,
     *::after {
       animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
       animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
       transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
       animation-delay: -0.01ms !important;
       transition-delay: -0.01ms !important;
     }
     
     * {
       transform: none !important;
     }
   }
   ```

### 5. JavaScript Verification
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Run the following code to check mobile detection:
   ```javascript
   // Check if mobile detection is working
   console.log('Window width:', window.innerWidth);
   console.log('Is mobile:', window.innerWidth < 768);
   ```

## Expected Results
